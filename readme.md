I built the Moments in Greece website to fulfill the program requirements for Code Louisvilleâ€™s Front-end Web Development Class.
I completed the project in November of 2017.
The Moments in Greece website is a photo gallery of my vacation to Greece in May of 2017.
I utilized Flickity for my photo carousels and initiated using jQuery.  Please find my homepage via the index.html file.  Flickity galleries are accessible via the athens.html and santorini.html files. I am not satisfied with the alignment of my photos in the gallery. They need to be centered both vertically and horizontally. The Flickity attributes are not working the way they should.
