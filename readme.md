I built the Moments in Greece website to fulfill the program requirements for Code Louisville’s Front-end Web Development Class.
I completed the project in November of 2017.
The Moments in Greece website is a photo gallery of my vacation to Greece in May of 2017.
I utilized Flickity for my photo carousels and initiated using jQuery.  Please find my homepage via the index.html file.  Flickity galleries are accessible via the athens.html and santorini.html files. I am not satisfied with the alignment of my photos in the gallery. They need to be centered both vertically and horizontally. The Flickity attributes are not working as expected. Still working on this detail.
