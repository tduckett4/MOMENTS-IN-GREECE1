I built the Moments in Greece website to fulfill the program requirements for Code Louisvilleâ€™s Front-end Web Development Class. 
I completed the project in November of 2017.
The Moments in Greece website is a photo gallery of my vacation to Greece in May of 2017.
I utilized Flickity for my photo carousels and initiated using jQuery.
